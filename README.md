# hej-spotify
Just in case you saw my application and you digged right into it, I've prepared some semi-hidden messages for you. 
There is so much to say why I love you so much, but instead let me tell you a story of how I actually heard about you for the first time.
Back in the year 2009, I had a half-german, half-swedish girlfriend. We decided to go on vacation mid August to her home country. She went there first, two weeks before I could fly to Stockholm. She´d spent some time at her sister´s place in Uppsala and we tried to be on the phone at least 2 times a week. Every time I called her she would listen to some of her favourite indie bands. I knew she wouldn´t carry all those CDs with her as she didn´t like packing to much stuff into her backpack. When I asked her what the music was all about, she said something like this: "Everybody here at the university is listening music through this crazy radio-like website called 'Spotify'. That struck my like lightning, as I was a witness to the death of Napser and Audio Galaxy. From there on I knew something good, something great was happening and I´ve been on that journey, the changes, the innovations and of course all the great music ever since.
